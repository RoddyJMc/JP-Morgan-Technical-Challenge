# JP-Morgan-Technical-Challenge
Tech challenge for Javascript dev role

Once you have cloned the repo...

Starting the server:

The server must be started first so navigate to :
[your_file_system]\git-tech-test\JP-Morgan-Technical-Challenge\server
with the command line and 'npm start'. Once the server has started you can navigate to http://localhost:8080/ 
in your browser and you will find the express server.

Starting the client app:

Once the server is running navigate to: [your_file_system]\JP-Morgan-Technical-Challenge\client-app
with the command line and 'npm start'. The client app should open in your default browser http://localhost:3000/.

Error handling GET fault/:

To change the error type navigate to [your_file_system]\JP-Morgan-Technical-Challenge\server\routes\fault.js.
The client app is configured to handle '404' and '500' errors at the moment.

Unit/end to end testing is still to be done unfortunately.
